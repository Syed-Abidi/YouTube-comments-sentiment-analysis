This script uses Streamlit to create a web app for analyzing YouTube comments. 
It fetches up to 300 comments from a video, filters out those with links and too many emojis.
and uses VADER sentiment analysis to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. 
The app displays the video's title, channel name, some sample comments, and visualizes the sentiment data with bar and pie charts.
If no relevant comments are found, it informs the user.
